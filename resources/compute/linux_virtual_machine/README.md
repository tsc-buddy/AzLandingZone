| additional\_capabilities | (Optional) A additional\_capabilities block as defined below. | `list` | `[]` | no |
| admin\_password | (Optional) The Password which should be used for the local-administrator on this Virtual Machine. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| admin\_ssh\_key\_public\_key | (Required) The Public Key which should be used for authentication, which needs to be at least 2048-bit and in ssh-rsa format. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"` | no |
| admin\_username | (Required) The username of the local administrator used for the Virtual Machine. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| allow\_extension\_operations | (Optional) Should Extension Operations be allowed on this Virtual Machine? Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| availability\_set\_id | (Optional) Specifies the ID of the Availability Set in which the Virtual Machine should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `null` | no |
| computer\_name | (Optional) Specifies the Hostname which should be used for this Virtual Machine. If unspecified this defaults to the value for the name field. If the value of the name field is not a valid computer\_name, then you must specify computer\_name. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `null` | no |
| custom\_data | (Optional) The Base64-Encoded Custom Data which should be used for this Virtual Machine. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `null` | no |
